        I am a creative problem-solver who is not afraid to take on new challenges. 
        I am confident that my determination and drive will allow me to succeed in any project I undertake.
    
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy making stickers, drawing and coding, where I am able to feel most at peace and express myself to the fullest.</p>

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site that I got to build with React.js. I am excited for the opportunity to demonstrate my potential and enthusiasm for design, and to begin my professional journey in this industry.</p>
